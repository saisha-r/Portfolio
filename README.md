# Saisha Rankaduwa's Portfolio

Welcome to my professional coding portfolio! I am a Master's student in Psychology and Neuroscience at Dalhousie University. To demonstrate my coding capabilities, on this page you will find examples of code I have written.

## Data Manipulation
To prepare data for analysis, here are codes that manipulate/clean data.

[Converting files into a single dataframe](converting_files_into_single_dataframe.md)

[Removing an outlier in lists](removing_an_outlier_in_lists.md)

[Trimming values using conditionals](trimming_values.md)

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The following codes summarize data in variety of formats, such as tables, plots, and t-tests. 

[Creating a table and point plot](creating_a_table_and_point_plot.md)

[Creating a histogram](creating_a_histogram.md)

[Computing t-tests](computing_t-tests.md)

## Demo

Here is a [demo](https://youtu.be/1ovBBDLfGm0) I made about keyboard shortcuts in IPython Shell.
